This page will present you all the functions that can be used to deal with harmonies, scales and various musical objects. Each function will be presented following the same model:
* **Type signature**: how the function is declared on the **Haskell** side.
* **Description**: verbal description of the function.
* **Examples**: a small list of examples that you can copy/paste in your editor.

## Scales
### scale
```haskell
Type: scale :: Num a => Pattern String -> Pattern Int -> Pattern a
```

The `scale` function interprets a pattern of note numbers into a particular named scale. For example:

```haskell
d1 $ jux rev $ chunk 4 (fast 2 . (|- n 12)) $ off 0.25 (|+ 7) $ struct (iter 4 "t(5,8)")
  $ n (scale "ritusen" "0 .. 7") # sound "superpiano"
```

:::caution
Prior to **Tidal** version 1.0.0, scale had a very different function as a `range` operator. Veteran users will need to switch to using `range` for this functionality.

### scaleList

```haskell
Type: scaleList :: String
```
The `scaleList` function outputs all the available scales, at the time of writing:

```

### scaleTable

```haskell
Type: scaleTable :: Fractional a => [(String, [a])]
```

The `scaleTable` function outputs a list of all available scales and their corresponding notes. For example, its first entry is `("minPent",[0.0,3.0,5.0,7.0,10.0])` which means that a minor pentatonic scale is formed by the root (`0`), the minor third (`3` semitones above the root), the perfect fourth (`5` semitones above the root), etc.

As the list is big, you can use the Haskell function `lookup` to look up a specific scale:

```haskell
lookup "phrygian" scaleTable
```

This will output `Just [0.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,7.0,8.0,10.0]`.

You can also do a reverse look up into the scale table. For example:

```haskell
filter (\(_,x)->take 3 x==[0,2,4]) scaleTable
```

The above example will output all scales, the first three notes of which are the root, the major second (`2` semitones above the fundamental), and the major third (`4` semitones above the root).

### getScale

```haskell
Type: getScale :: Num a => [(String, [a])] -> Pattern String -> Pattern Int -> Pattern a
```
You can build your own `scale` function with additional scales if you wish, using `getScale`. For example:

```haskell
let scale = getScale (scaleTable ++ [("techno", [0,2,3,5,7,8,10]),
                                     ("broken", [0,1,4,7,8,10])
                                    ])
```

The above takes the standard `scaleTable` as a starting point, and adds two custom scales to it. You'll be able to use the new function as normal:

```haskell
d1 $ n (scale "techno" "0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7") # sound "superpiano"
```

### toScale

```haskell
Type: toScale :: Num a => [a] -> Pattern Int -> Pattern a
```

`toScale` allows you to quickly apply a scale without naming it. For example:

```haskell
d1 $ n (toScale [0,2,3,5,7,8,10] "0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7") # sound "superpiano"
```


## Chords

### chordList

```haskell
Type: chordList :: String
```

The `chordList` function outputs all the available chords. At the time of writing:

```plaintext

```

:::caution
You'll need to run `import Sound.Tidal.Chords` before using this function.
:::

### chordTable

```haskell
Type: chordTable :: Num a => [(String, [a])]
```

The `chordTable` function outputs a list of all available chords and their corresponding notes. For example, its first entry is `("major",[0,4,7])` which means that a major triad is formed by the root (`0`), the major third (`4` semitones above the root), and the perfect fifth (`7` semitones above the root).

As the list is big, you can use the function `chordL` to look up a specific chord:

```haskell
chordL "minor7"
```

This will output `(0>1)|[0,3,7,10]`.

If you know the notes from a chord, but can't find the name of it, you can use this Haskell code to do a reverse look up into the table:

```haskell
filter (\(_,x)->x==[0,4,7,10]) chordTable
```

This will output: `[("dom7",[0,4,7,10])]`

:::caution
You'll need to run `import Sound.Tidal.Chords` before using this function.

## Arpeggios

### arpeggiate

```haskell
Type: arpeggiate :: Pattern a -> Pattern a
```

The `arpeggiate` (alias `arpg`) function spreads chords of note numbers over time. For example, using the `1.0` version of **Tidal**, chord name notation & older list notation:

```haskell
d1 $ n (arpg "'major7 [0,4,7,11]") # sound "superpiano"
```

### arp

```haskell
Type: arp :: Pattern String -> Pattern a -> Pattern a
```

The `arp` function takes an additional pattern of arpeggiate modes. For example, using the `1.0` version of **Tidal**, chord name notation (root note / chord type / additional notes above the chord):

```haskell
d1 $ n (arp "<up down diverge>" "<a'm9'8 e'7sus4'8>") # sound "superpiano"
```

The different arpeggiate modes are:
```haskell
up down updown downup up&down down&up converge
diverge disconverge pinkyup pinkyupdown
thumbup thumbupdown
```

### rolled

```haskell
Type: rolled :: Pattern a -> Pattern a
```

The `rolled` function takes no arguments, and simulates a downward strum pattern on a guitar. Notes are played low to high, and are evenly distributed within (1/4) of the chord event length, as opposed to `arp`/`arpeggiate` that spread the notes over the whole event.

```haskell
d1 $ rolled $ n "<a'm9'8 e'7sus4'8>" # sound "superpiano"
```

### rolledBy

```haskell
Type: rolledBy :: Pattern (Ratio Integer) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a
```

The `rolledBy` function works the same as `rolled`, but allows you to specify the fraction of the event that the notes will be spread over, or the "length" of the roll.

```haskell
d1 $ rolledBy 0.45 $ n "<a'm9'8 e'7sus4'8>" # sound "superpiano"
```
